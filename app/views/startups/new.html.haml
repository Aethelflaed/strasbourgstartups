    By submitting this form, you will ask us to add your startup to the directory. Notice that we deeply care about the quality of the entries: we only want startups, from Strasbourg and its surrounding area. We want real companies, not just idea living its only life on a PowerPoint. That's why we'll ask you to come demo your product during one of our Demo Night/Demo Day.
