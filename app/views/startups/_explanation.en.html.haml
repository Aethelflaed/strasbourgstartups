  By submitting this form, you will ask us to join the "Strasbourg Startups" group. Notice that we deeply care about the quality of the entries: we only want startups, from Strasbourg and its surrounding area. We want real companies, not just an idea living its only life on a PowerPoint. That's why we'll ask you to come demo your product during one of our Demo Night/Demo Day. After your presentation, a council composed of all the founders already present in the directory will validate (or not) your proposal to be part of the directory.
